It is Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy and second shortest play, with about 2,500 lines. There is also a famous superstition where people believed the name of the play should not be spoken, it is instead referred to as “The Scottish Play” as it was set in Scotland.  <br> <br>

The story follows three witches telling the Scottish general, Macbeth, that he would soon be King of England. Blinded by ambition and supported by his wife, Lady Macbeth— he killed the Scottish king, King Duncan and soon received the throne. Soon, driven by paranoia, he kills more and more people, resulting in a civil war, overthrowing him and his throne. The play ends with him and his wife dying and reflects the effects of ambition and greed.

It is considered one of his greatest tragedies, yet is unpublished by Shakespeare. Many criticized its performances and adaptations as it was originally performed by white people with dark makeup, gaining more attention for its treatment of race.  <br> <br>

The story is set in Venice and Cyprus and follows Othello who is the general in the Venetian military and is a noble Moor. One of his most trusted ensign, Iago, is very jealous and furious about being overlooked for promotion. Despite Othello’s trust in him, he plots to take revenge on him and manipulates him into thinking that his wife, Desdemona, is unfaithful which stirred up Othello’s anger. Letting his rage consume and fuel him, Othello murders his wife, and eventually kills himself too.

    <div class="work-item tragedies" data-title="King Lear" data-desc='King Lear is a tragedy written by Shakespeare in late 1605 or early 1606. The earliest known performance was on Saint Stephen’s Day, around late December, in 1606. The original play is considered to be one of Shakespeare’s greatest achievements, and is often cited as one of the greatest pieces of literature to exist. <br> <br>

The play is set in pre-Roman Britain with Lear as the King of Britain. He has three daughters— Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia and decided to do a love-test. The two eldest daughters, Goneril and Regan, flatter their father so much so that the king decides to split the kingdom between them and banishes Cordelia despite her sincerity. However, his two daughters then reject him at their own homes, driving him mad and into a heavy storm. Later, Cordelia, his banished daughter, returns— but with an army behind her. King Lear loses in battle and dies along with his daughters and many others.

The young couple arrange a wedding for the next day, but Juliet’s cousin named Tybalt dies partly because of Romeo, leading to him being banished. Juliet, longing to reunite with Romeo, fakes her own death but Romeo believes it and takes his own life in her tomb. When Juliet wakes up to see Romeo beside her, cold and dead, she takes her own life as well, leaving nothing but a grieving family and chaos.
