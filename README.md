## Loading Page Design

To ensure a polished user experience, a **loading page** appears before the site fully loads, especially for slow internet connections.

### Visual Style
Inspired by **Elizabethan manuscript borders**, the loading screen uses a parchment background framed by **blue, green, and orange floral designs** (based on the reference border image).  

Centered on the screen:
🖋️ Shakespeare’s Quill
“Loading timeless tales…”


Typography: *Playfair Display*, navy blue (#003366)  
Animation:  
- The border fades in gently.  
- A small **quill icon** performs a subtle writing or rotation animation.  
- Once loading is complete, the border fades out to reveal the Home page.

### Hidden “Ophelia” Reference
A subtle nod to **Taylor Swift’s album _The Life of a Showgirl_**, referencing her song *“The Fate of Ophelia.”*  
During the loading screen, faint text briefly appears in cursive at the bottom corner:

> *“The fate of Ophelia whispers in the wings.”*

This Easter egg fits naturally within the Shakespearean theme — honoring *Hamlet’s* tragic Ophelia while bridging classical and contemporary artistry.

# Part 2 - Updated Project Proposal
# User Data System: The Shakespeare’s Quill Society

## Overview

To meet the Web Development project requirements, the **Shakespeare’s Quill** website will incorporate an interactive **user data system** known as the **Shakespeare’s Quill Society**. This feature allows visitors to create a personalized Shakespeare profile and maintain a digital reading journal directly on the site. By leveraging **JavaScript LocalStorage**, the system stores data locally on the user's device, ensuring persistence across browser sessions. This transforms the website from a static information hub into a **student-centered literary platform**, fostering active engagement with Shakespeare’s works.

## Purpose of the HTML Form

The HTML form acts as the entry point for users to join the **Shakespeare’s Quill Society**. Upon submission, it creates a **Shakespeare Reader Profile**, personalizing the user's experience across the website.

The form collects the following information:
- User's name
- Email address
- Favorite Shakespeare play
- Preferred genre (Tragedy, Comedy, History, Poetry)
- A short personal reflection on why they enjoy Shakespeare

This data is stored locally and used to generate tailored content on other site pages.

## Proposed Data-Driven Web Pages

Three new webpages will be integrated to support the user data system. These pages will seamlessly share and utilize the saved user data.

### `signup.html` — Join the Shakespeare’s Quill Society

This page hosts the primary **HTML form** for user registration, serving as the gateway to the website's interactive features.

#### Design & Functionality
- Styled as a **classical parchment** for thematic immersion.
- Includes input fields for all required user details.
- Features a prominent "Join" button in muted orange.

Upon form submission, JavaScript saves the data to LocalStorage for retrieval by other pages.

### `profile.html` — User Shakespeare Profile

This page retrieves and displays the user's personalized **Shakespeare Reader Profile** based on data from `signup.html`.

#### Purpose
- Showcases a customized welcome message incorporating the user's name.
- Highlights the user's favorite play, preferred genre, and personal reflection.
- Demonstrates effective data retrieval and meaningful application, aligning with project requirements.

### `journal.html` — Shakespeare Reader’s Journal

This page enables users to create, save, and review entries in their personal digital journal.

#### Purpose
- Allows writing and saving reflections, reactions, or interpretations of Shakespeare’s works.
- Supports multiple entries, stored locally for easy access.
- Provides a persistent digital notebook, representing the second instance of data utilization across pages.

## Data Storage System

All user data is managed via **JavaScript LocalStorage**, ensuring secure, device-based storage without external dependencies.

### Stored Data Elements
- User profile details (name, email, favorite play, genre, reflection).
- Journal entries (as an array of objects for multiple entries).

Data is structured as JSON objects for efficient retrieval and display.
