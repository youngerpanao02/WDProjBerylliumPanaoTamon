        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, around April 23, 1564. He was the third of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a prosperous glove-maker, leatherworker, and local official who served as an alderman and bailiff, and Mary Arden, the daughter of a wealthy landowner. The Shakespeare family was middle-class, with John holding various civic positions, though he faced financial difficulties later in life, possibly due to debts and legal issues. Shakespeare's siblings included older sisters Joan and Margaret (who died young), and younger brothers Gilbert, Richard, Edmund, and Anne.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare likely attended the King's New School in Stratford-upon-Avon, a free grammar school established in 1553. The curriculum focused on Latin classics, rhetoric, and literature, providing a strong foundation in classical education. While no direct records of his attendance exist, his works show deep knowledge of Latin authors like Ovid, Plautus, and Seneca, as well as English literature. He did not attend university, which was common for those from his background, and left school around age 14 or 15 to help with family business or pursue other paths.

In November 1582, at age 18, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, an older woman from a nearby village, who was about 26. Their first child, Susanna, was born in May 1583, followed by twins Hamnet and Judith in February 1585. Hamnet died at age 11 in 1596, an event that may have influenced Shakespeare's later works, such as Hamlet. During this period, Shakespeare lived in Stratford, possibly working as a schoolmaster, lawyer's clerk, or in his father's glove-making trade, though details are scarce due to limited surviving records.

      london: `
        <h2>London Years</h2>
        <p>Shakespeare likely moved to London in the late 1580s or early 1590s, possibly around 1587, though exact dates are uncertain. Theories suggest he fled Stratford to escape persecution for poaching deer on a local estate (a common crime), or he was drawn by London's booming theater scene. By 1592, he was established as an actor and playwright in the city. He joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men, an acting company patronized by Queen Elizabeth I, and became a key member. Early roles included acting in his own plays, and he began writing prolifically, producing works like the Henry VI trilogy (c. 1590-1592) and Richard III (c. 1592-1593), which drew on historical sources and appealed to audiences fascinated by England's past.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's London years coincided with the Elizabethan theater's golden age. He collaborated with actors like Richard Burbage and wrote for the company's success. By 1599, he co-founded the Globe Theatre on the south bank of the Thames, a wooden amphitheater that seated up to 3,000 spectators. It became a hub for his plays, including comedies like A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1595-1596) and The Merchant of Venice (c. 1596-1597), histories such as Henry V (c. 1599), and tragedies like Romeo and Juliet (c. 1595) and Julius Caesar (c. 1599). His works often premiered at the Globe or the indoor Blackfriars Theatre. Shakespeare also invested in real estate, buying properties like New Place in Stratford, and became a shareholder in the King's Men after James I ascended in 1603, renaming the company.

      later: `
        <h2>Later Works</h2>
        <p>William Shakespeare was an English playwright and poet from the late 1500s to early 1600s who became famous for creating stories and characters that still feel relatable today. He wrote around 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and several long poems. His plays are usually grouped into three main categories: tragedies, comedies, and histories. His tragedies explore serious themes like ambition, jealousy, and fate, with famous examples such as Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, and King Lear. His comedies, on the other hand, are lighter and often revolve around love, mistaken identities, and humor; some well-known ones include A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, and As You Like It. Shakespeare also wrote history plays, which dramatize the lives of English kings and political conflicts—these include Richard III, Henry V, and Henry IV Parts 1 and 2. Beyond his plays, Shakespeare’s 154 sonnets are some of the most famous poems in the world, exploring themes like time, beauty, love, and mortality. Overall, his works are known for their deep emotions, memorable characters, and powerful language that continues to influence literature and entertainment today.</p>

      legacy: `
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Shakespeare’s legacy is enormous—he’s considered one of the most influential writers in history, and his impact is still felt everywhere today. Even though he lived over 400 years ago, his stories, characters, and phrases continue to shape literature, theater, film, and even the way we speak.
First, Shakespeare transformed English literature. He expanded the expressive power of the English language, inventing or popularizing hundreds of words and phrases people still use today, like break the ice, wild-goose chase, and heart of gold. His works also showed how complex and emotionally realistic characters could be, influencing countless authors, playwrights, and screenwriters.

In terms of storytelling, Shakespeare introduced plots and character types that became templates for modern drama. Themes like forbidden love (Romeo and Juliet), ambition (Macbeth), jealousy (Othello), and identity (Twelfth Night) appear everywhere in movies, TV shows, and books. His characters feel human—flawed, conflicted, and relatable—which changed the way writers create fiction.

Shakespeare also left a huge mark on the theater world. His plays are performed more than any other playwright’s, in every country and in almost every language. The Globe Theatre, associated with his company, became a symbol of world theater. Modern acting techniques, stage conventions, and even the idea of a “tragic hero” were shaped by his works.

His legacy extends to education too. Students worldwide study his plays not just because they’re old, but because they tackle universal emotions and questions that people still face today—love, power, fear, loyalty, and the search for meaning.

Overall, Shakespeare’s legacy is the way he helped define storytelling, enriched the English language, and created timeless works that continue to inspire artists, thinkers, and audiences centuries later.
